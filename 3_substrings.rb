Algorithms:

- Create (result) -> an empty hash
- Create (splitted) -> an array of inputted words that have been splitted into each letter for each word

- Loop each word in dictionary
    - Loop each array in splitted
        - Loop each letter in each splitted array
            - If word[0] is equal to letter
                - Join the letters in array starting from the current letter to word.length-1
                - Compare the joined letters with word
                - If it's the same, check whether the key exists in (result)
                    - If it exists, add 1
                    - If not, assign 1 to result[word]
