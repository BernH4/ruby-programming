## 1. Anagrams

Based on exercise 8 from [LaunchSchool's Hashes Chapter](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes).

Challenge: Given the array...

```ruby
words =  ['demo', 'none', 'tied', 'evil', 'dome', 'mode', 'live','fowl', 'veil', 'wolf', 'diet', 'vile', 'edit', 'tide','flow', 'neon']
```

Write a program that prints out groups of words that are anagrams. Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order. Your output should look something like this:

```ruby
["demo", "dome", "mode"]
["neon", "none"]
(etc)
```
